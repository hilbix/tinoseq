I don't know why, but it looks like there are cases where the
ordinary seq does not do it's job.  This here is supposed to
only work for (long) integers.

Currrently it works with a signed 64 bit number, but in future
I might extend this to include arbitrary long integers.

One difference exists to the "normal" seq:  If you try to
increment by 0 this here bails out, as for this type you
can use "yes number" instead (and increment 0 shall be
something weird, anyway).
